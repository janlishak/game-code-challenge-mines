## Story
One day I decided to do as little code challenge and recreate one of my favorite games of my childhood. In this simple game the player’s goal is to find all the mines only by knowing how many surrounding mines are on the tiles which were already clicked on. The player must be carful on which tiles to stamp because if there is a mine it will explode, and the game is over. 
## Installation
* game was tested with version 3.8 of python, but any python 3 version should work
* if your installation does not include graphical library tkinter you need to install it to run the game
